# 2D-World-Map-Generator
 
A simple Unity prototype that reads data from a geojson file of countries in the world and generates a single object for each country.

To build the meshes, a version of the EarClipping algorithm was implemented (docu here: https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf).
